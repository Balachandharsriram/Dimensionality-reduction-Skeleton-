# 🚀 Dimensionality Reduction Skeleton

**Transform high-dimensional chaos into meaningful insights!** This Python-based project, built on **Jupyter Notebook**, provides a structured approach to **dimensionality reduction** for efficient data visualization and model performance optimization.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
✅ **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – Retain variance while reducing dimensions.  
✅ **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)** – For powerful nonlinear visualization.  
✅ **Autoencoders** – Neural networks for feature compression.  
✅ **Feature Selection** – Identify and retain the most valuable data points.  
✅ **Performance Benchmarking** – Compare models before and after reduction.

## 📥 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dimensionality-reduction-skeleton.git
cd dimensionality-reduction-skeleton
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Launch the **Jupyter Notebook** and explore step-by-step implementation:
```bash
jupyter notebook Dimensionality_Reduction.ipynb
```

### 📝 Quick Example in Python:
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
data = np.random.rand(100, 50)  # 100 samples, 50 features

# Apply PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(data)
print(reduced_data.shape)  # (100, 2)
```
